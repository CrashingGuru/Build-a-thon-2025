**Focus Group AI‑Native for Telecom Networks (FG‑AINN) Build-a-thon 2025**
in Collaboration with ITU AI/ML 5G Challenge.

---

## 🎯 Challenge Overview

ITU FG AINN Build-a-thon 2025 aims to build designs and demonstrations for studying the key concepts discussed in the FG. The Build-a-thon will document and showcase the feasibility and considerations of the key concepts using currently available design and implementation approaches.

## 🗓 Build-a-thon 1.0 Timeline & Participation

- **Mentoring sessions** via Zoom (May 23 – June 6, 2025): Tuesdays & Fridays at 15:00 IST  
- **In-person Build‑a‑thon**: June 11–13, 2025, Vigyan Bhawan, New Delhi  
- **Travel reimbursement**: up to ₹15,000 per head for teams (max 3 members)  
- **Accommodation**: provided for selected teams.

## 🗓 Build-a-thon 2.0 Timeline & Participation
- We are thrilled to announce that ITU Focus Group on AI Native Networks Build-a-thon will be extended to Geneva. Code named “Build-a-thon 2.0”, it will culminate in a live showcase in Geneva on 11th July 2025, held alongside the 4th Meeting of the ITU-T FG-AINN. 

- Continuing from Build-a-thon 1.0, we enhance the proposals, moving toward robust, demonstrable Proofs of Concept (PoCs) with tangible code and demos. Build-a-thon 2.0 would feature new teams joining the competition and mentoring will be extended to all interested teams.
Participants are expected to aim for deeper technical maturity, clear alignment with AI-native principles, and readiness for live demonstration. 

- Mentoring Schedule (All sessions at 4:00 PM CET):
  - Session 1: Friday, 20th June: Orientation to Build-a-thon 2.0, lessons from Build-a-thon 1.0, and intro to new teams.
  - Session 2: Tuesday, 24th June: Design and Code reviews and open Q&A.
  - Session 3: Friday, 27th June: Check-in on progress, AI native validation, and demo preparation checkpoints.
  - Session 4: Tuesday, 1st July: Mock walkthroughs of PoCs, feedback on code, and execution plans.
  - Session 5 (Final): Friday, 4th July: Final mentoring session, readiness review, and showcase demo video.
 
- Final submission deadline - 4th July 2025, midnight CEST.


## 🏆 Objectives

The broad objectives of the Build-a-thon are:
- Analyse AI Native for telecommunication networks use cases, requirements and foster awareness on the FG activities.
- Derive new contributions for the FG-AINN in the areas of:
- Standardization Gaps
- Use Cases
- Architectures
- Proofs of Concept (PoCs)
  - Explore practical feasibility and trade-offs of AI-native networks via PoCs for specific use cases and architecture concepts.
  - Facilitate hands-on engagement through crowd-sourced coding and development activities.
  - Engage stakeholders in discussions and collaborations to advance AI-native networks, especially a crowd-sourced coding activity involving academia, industry and startups.

## 🧩 Repo Structure
